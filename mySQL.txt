to create a table ==>
            CREATE TABLE teachers (
            id INTEGER, 
            NAME TEXT, 
            age INTEGER
            );


to insert a value/row in table ==>

        INSERT INTO teachers (id, age, NAME) VALUES (12, 35, "Sujon");


not to get any duplicate items ==> 
        SELECT DISTINCT NAME FROM teachers;

WHERE clause filters the result set to only include rows where the following condition is true.
                SELECT *
                FROM movies
                WHERE imdb_rating > 8;


LIKE can be a useful operator when you want to compare similar values.
                SELECT * 
                FROM movies
                WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en';


to get only start or end with letter ==>
                SELECT * 
                FROM movies
                WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

                 SELECT * 
                FROM movies
                WHERE name LIKE '%A';

                 SELECT * 
                FROM movies
                WHERE name LIKE 'The %';

to get any value of colume is null or not null ==>

                SELECT name
                FROM movies 
                WHERE imdb_rating IS NOT NULL;
                

                SELECT name
                FROM movies 
                WHERE imdb_rating IS NULL;


get any value between ==>

                SELECT *
                FROM movies
                WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;

                SELECT *
                FROM movies
                WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'C';
                ==> return values only name starts with A & B.


And operator 

                SELECT * 
                FROM movies
                WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999
                AND genre = 'romance';

                SELECT *

                WHERE year < 1985
                AND genre = 'horror';

OR operator
                SELECT *
                FROM movies
                WHERE year > 2014
                OR genre = 'action';


                SELECT *
                FROM movies
                WHERE genre = 'romance'
                OR genre = 'comedy';

Work With Multiple table 

Combining Tables with SQL
13 min
Combining tables manually is time-consuming. Luckily, SQL gives us an easy sequence for this: it’s called a

JOIN
.

If we want to combine orders and customers, we would type:

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

Copy to Clipboard

Let’s break down this command:

The first line selects all columns from our combined table. If we only want to select certain columns, we can specify which ones we want.
The second line specifies the first table that we want to look in, orders
The third line uses JOIN to say that we want to combine information from orders with customers.
The fourth line tells us how to combine the two tables. We want to match orders table’s customer_id column with customers table’s customer_id column.
Because column names are often repeated across multiple tables, we use the syntax table_name.column_name to be sure that our requests for columns are unambiguous. In our example, we use this syntax in the ON statement, but we will also use it in the

SELECT
 or any other statement where we refer to column names.

For example: Instead of selecting all the columns using *, if we only wanted to select orders table’s order_id column and customers table’s customer_name column, we could use the following query:

SELECT orders.order_id,
   customers.customer_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Failed, try again
1.
Join orders table and subscriptions table and select all columns.

Make sure to join on the subscription_id column.

Checkpoint 2 Step instruction is unavailable until previous steps are completed
2.
Don’t remove the previous query.

Add a second query after your first one that only selects rows from the join where description is equal to ‘Fashion Magazine’.
