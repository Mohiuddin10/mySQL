to create a table ==>
            CREATE TABLE teachers (
            id INTEGER, 
            NAME TEXT, 
            age INTEGER
            );


to insert a value/row in table ==>

        INSERT INTO teachers (id, age, NAME) VALUES (12, 35, "Sujon");


not to get any duplicate items ==> 
        SELECT DISTINCT NAME FROM teachers;

WHERE clause filters the result set to only include rows where the following condition is true.
                SELECT *
                FROM movies
                WHERE imdb_rating > 8;
